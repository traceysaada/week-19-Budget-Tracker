# Online/Offline Budget Trackers

this application will allow a user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. 


# Offline Functionality:

When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

# When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker & send updated info to the database

## User Story

The ability to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
will be great when travelling so that information can be stored off line & added when back on line should the internet connection be lost or I am in an area where there is no internet signal.

Then when in an area where there is internet will update all new information when internet is back on line.

## Business Context

Allowing access to information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success. so the user has an updated correct cash flow at all times.

## comments on application

* I had a few issues as this was the first time I had used mongo Atlas but followed instructions & have been able to deply

* a few debug issues but I am learing how to read in inspec & console also in the terminal as it show them    clearly here as well

* tested the application & it works on line & offline, then when I go back on line it updates the database. so very please that it is working & I managed to do the debug & deploy as this is also part of learning to code.
